      <h3><tt>Hi there,</br> I'm <big>Miller Favour</big>, A student of Electrical Electronics Engineering at the University of Lagos,Nigeria.
   </h3>
      <h3><big>The mind traveller(TMT)</big>is a website where you can get access to books ranging from romance to horror to any genre you can think of.</br> You get to also give reviews and be recommended books that you might like by other readers.</h3>
      <h3>The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go</br> From the reading of ‘good books’</br> there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way.What better occupation,really, than to spend the evening at the fireside with a book, with the wind beating on the windows and the lamp burning bright</h3>
      <h3>So here at TMT, We provide a nice and friendly environment to read, review and help your mind travel </h3>
      <h3>One glance at a book and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for 1,000 years. To read is to voyage through	time.We are of opinion that instead of letting books grow moldy behind an iron grating, far from the vulgar gaze, it is better to let them wear out by being read. </h3>
      
     <h1> Never put off till tomorrow the book you can read today!!</h1>
